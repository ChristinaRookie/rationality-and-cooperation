# 1. Rational Choice as Utility Maximization

Rationality in the Rational Choice model is seen as an instrument to maximize utility, which is conceived as the satisfaction of preferences. Indifference curves map the ordinal measures of the ranking and relative weight of preferences for different bundles of goods; all preferences are ranked by reducing concerns to utility so that this single value can be maximized. The rational actor is supposed to be using this method, implicitly or explicitly, to weigh up the bundles of choice and elucidate the action that will best serve their interests, their utility. This provides the means for choosing between actions, and conceives of rational choice as the action that can be expected to satisfy the individual’s preferences best. In the adoption of this framework, we understand an action as the outcome of competing preferences. Where it is difficult to express which option an actor values most, we can force them to make a choice and use it to depict the evaluation of options.[^2]

According to Arrow, the conditions of rationality, which a supposed rational actor needs to embody before they can even begin to deliberate about maximization, are those of “common sense”.[^3] These are completeness and transitivity. Completeness requires that an actor can rank each and all goods relative to one another, and makes no allowances for being unable to choose between, or lacking an adequate measure to compare two options. For example, I must know whether I prefer working to playing, the measure I must use is simply utility (there is no thicker description such as “I prefer working when fulfilment or esteem are my concerns but prefer playing when stress-release is my concern”), the preference is seen to be given, its satisfaction reducible to utility, and its occurrence unrelated from the situation at hand.

Transitivity requires that if you prefer bundle X to Y, and Y to Z, then you should prefer X to Z. Say, for instance, that you preferred X to Y and Y to Z but preferred Z to X, then you could keep substituting for more preferred bundles and wouldn’t be able to make a reasonable choice, this is the standard argument for transitivity at least (which also does away with thick, contextual descriptions, and assumes that evaluations are reducible to one scale of value, utility).[^4] In the first place, this model assumes that it makes sense to represent all deliberation and choice as a matter of utility maximization (seen as preference satisfaction), and importantly, that all bundles of goods are substitutable for one another at some hypothetical exchange rate for the actor, that all ways in which things are valued can be reduced to a common measure.

Rational action, in this model, is seen as motivated by preferences, relative desires for goods. So for example if empirical investigation led us to believe that someone performed an act of altruism, we would explain this by figuring in a preference for altruism, or a preference for the safety of others that amounted to a personal benefit, an increase in utility, when satisfied. In economic theory, no one ever does “something for nothing”; a rational person would only choose to do an action because the benefits it accrued to them outweighed the costs. However, if we don’t take this as given, it seems fallacious to post hoc theorize and fill in the motivation by assuming a desire for any such thing to make sense of the action. This post hoc inference of a preference for altruism does nothing to provide an independent reason for the claim that action is only motivated by personal opportunities for satisfaction, which the Rational Choice theorists take as a plainly obvious part of rationality.[^5] The theory amounts to a post hoc rationalization of the agent’s choices, rather than a theory that is actually seen to guide or predict choices. In fact, if an agent were simply basing their decisions on the rationale of utility maximization (especially if conceived of as constrained to tangible costs and benefits), *their* “rational” behaviour would seem in need of explanation, one such explanation would be that it was an especially constrained case where only matters of benefits and costs were valuable and meaningful to them (for example, a cut-throat business manager trying to increase the bottom line).

Rational Choice theory assumes that everything comes down to a personal cost-benefit analysis, and no belief about what you “should” do or “must” do can motivate you directly, the only way to account for a normative belief is to fit it into a preference ordering where it must compete with other desires. Desires provide motivation, and no explanation is given to how desires themselves are motivated. In the reductionist framework of value, motivation and desire are akin to urges and likings, given and not capable of being motivated endogenously to rational deliberation. Let us put aside impending worries about transitivity, commensurability of concerns or values, motivation, and conceiving of rationality as a priori and based on purely instrumental deliberation for preference satisfaction. Let us confront a paradox of rationality, assuming for the while the Rational Choice theorist’s conception of it.
