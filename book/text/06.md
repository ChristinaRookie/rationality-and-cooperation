# 6. The Context for Appropriate Cooperation

Social Dilemmas (the iterated n-person generalisations of Prisoner’s Dilemmas, which we encountered in §2 with Hardin) are structural, rather than incidental problems.[^47] In this way cooperation is distinguished from an isolated act of helping, it is a sustained effort, comprised of many interdependent individuals who are all affected by the levels of cooperation.[^48] The nature of the “game” is such that people will all be better off if they cooperate, but an emphasis on competition for self-interest satisfaction as opponents leads all of their individual interests to be undermined with the social interest. In order for people to cooperate, they must feel like they have a good reason to do so, I have never denied that, all I have argued is that assuming actors are motivated solely by individual costs and benefits, and incapable of having normative reasons for action, is misleading and detrimental to levels of cooperation when the implications are imposed on the actors. Awareness of the problem, willingness to contribute, and the perception of potential efficacy determine individual cooperative behaviour.[^49] One way in which actors can try overcome the dilemma is to move beyond their parochial vantage point and realise that they would all be better off if they coordinated their actions to cooperate; but it would still pay more for a few individuals to defect while other’s cooperated, and those who were committed to cooperating would in theory face a second (and regressive) public goods dilemma when they had to enforce the norm or monitor compliance. Regard for the common good, norms that promote motivations to act for the common good, and conformance to the norms, are all important for the common good to actually be achieved. Let us go through these challenges with some suggestions from empirical studies on such “dilemmas”.

Understanding the relevance of the promotion of the common good, properly valuing it as well as the others who will benefit from it, and seeing oneself as depended upon in the situation, are all important to increase ones regard for the good in question, and thus to provide a motivational reason for action. In this way the problem is not approached as a dilemma (a conflict between individual and collective interests), it is approached as an opportunity for collective action to achieve everyone’s aims. Even in the absence of such cues and induced motivations, standard prisoners dilemmas have been found to produce much more cooperation than expected by Rational Choice Theory: in a meta-analysis of lab’ games played from 1958-1995, the average rate of cooperation was 47.4%.[^50] This level of cooperation is hardly negligible, and serves to show that the Rational Choice model is at best incomplete as an explanation of behaviour, and at worst, radically wrong in the first place about rational actor’s reasons for cooperation.

Social norms and ideals that express the regard for the common good, and promote it, are essential to entrenching and actualizing a (socially and individually aligned) desired result. Cialdini et al. draw a distinction between injunctive, and descriptive norms. *Injunctive norms* describe what you think others would approve of; *descriptive norms* describe what you think others do in practice.[^51] The strategy Tit-for-Tat does so well in Prisoner’s Dilemma simulations precisely because it is “nice” on the first round, providing clear expectations of its behaviour, a descriptive norm, to other participants; and because it punishes non co-operators and forgives them after that, providing a clear injunctive norm of reciprocity.[^52] In some experiments when the Social Dilemma games were relabelled as “Community Game” rather than “Stock Exchange Game”, cooperation increased, as it did when players were given descriptions that used the words “trust” and “cooperation” rather than “bargaining” and “competition”.[^53] Another separate and significant result of iterated experimental games was that labelling players as “opponents” produced significantly lower levels of mutual cooperation (27.3% and mutual defection: 53.8%) than when they were labelled “partners” (46.6% and mutual defection: 29.7%), the authors of this study conclude that relational models can “awaken” competitive, individualistic and egoistic behaviour, which is detrimental to total payoffs and goal accomplishment when there is mutual dependency on each other’s choices.[^54] The reframing of the situation does nothing to physically change the payoffs of the players, but it subtly tells them how they should value and treat each other, and influences their reasons for action.

Attempting to include social factors (such as social norms) in an expected utility function does nothing to prove that individuals actually gain utility from those social factors; it rather tautologically states that since individuals act off considerations of utility, there must be some added utility to them of those social factors which motivates and explains their action, rather than being motivated directly by one’s conception of the right thing to do. In experiments of social dilemmas without sanctions, with weak sanctions, and with strong sanctions respectively, the strong sanctions groups performed the best, the groups without sanctions did almost as well, and the groups with weak sanctions did significantly worse. When asked to choose how they framed the question, most of the participants in groups with strong and weak sanctions chose “business decision”, and the groups with no sanctions were more likely to choose “ethical decision”. They note that when strong sanctions are in place we can also expect more cooperation, but the basis for it (namely, a cost-benefit analysis result) will be very different from cooperation under a situation with no sanctions, “the sanctioning system influences the frame, but it is the frame that determines the behavior.”[^55]

The lab’ results go some way to showing that, at least, context matters when explaining or predicting rational choice; the net and individual outcomes are heavily influenced by the distinct nature of the context and framing for determining appropriate action, given by cues to social relations and norms of the community. In the end, norms for action that embody social relations determine the level of cooperation. Those that are, in Fiske’s terms[^56], formed on an Equality Matching or Community Sharing relational model rather than a Market model, do better in net and individual outcomes, although the dominant choice under the Rational Choice framing of the situation, if one knows the game will end, is to always defect. Cases in the super-contextual and socially embedded outside world provide further and stronger evidence for the effect of relational models and norms for behaviour on reasons for action and cooperative behaviour.

Klandermans found that a cost-benefit approach was unable to explain cooperation in social movements (conceived as a public good), and that an identity tied to the social interest was essential in determining actions on behalf of the group.[^57] In a study of fishermen’s compliance with regulations in the UK, Hatcher et al. found that a significant proportion comply even though probability of detecting defection and the amount of the penalty are low. They found that psychosocial factors such as feeling of involvement with the management system, a belief that quotas should be complied with even if they were (distributively) unfair, and the perceived attitude of peers to violation significantly determined the probability that an individual would comply, as well as the expected factors of perceived probability of getting caught and the anticipated fine.[^58] Violators were found to have a much higher expectation of violation of their peers; and a perception that “outsiders”, EU fishermen in the UK local waters, were not complying also had a negative influence on compliance.[^59]

Elffers found that although most Western tax administrations don’t have regular audits and the possibility of fraud detection is rare, a large proportion of people pay tax and comply, significantly overcoming or avoiding a public goods dilemma; he found that if people held the belief that others were better off in the system (not doing their fair share), they were less likely to pay tax themselves.[^60] Tyler found that in cases where collective restraint is necessary to manage a resource, willingness to comply with authorities’ regulations was linked to procedural fairness, because procedures convey information about the status of the community, and individual’s standing within the context, shaping individual’s identities and commitments to the community.[^61] Cropanzo and Byrne found that workers commitment to their firms and dedication to the firm’s interest (where the shared goods of high productivity for high wages and profit are at stake) were more significantly determined by perceived *procedural justice* (the rules determining pay and status) as well as perceived *interactional justice* (the relation between the worker and their manager) than simply *distributive* justice (fairness of pay). A lack of procedural and interactional justice was found to decrease trust and commitment to an organisation.[^62]

Many scholars have also found that *commitment* strategies work better than *control* strategies in the workplace.[^63] Communicating a lack of value of or trust in the employee, as simply a producer and seller of labour, as someone who seeks to minimize their effort and production levels (as predicted by the Rational Choice model), rather than someone who is trustworthy and valuable to the organisation, serves to displace their intrinsic and normative motivations, resulting in lower productivity, lower happiness at work, and alienation from each other and the practice.

Conformance to the norms is likely to be greatly influenced by the convergence and expression of collective interests in action. However, if a system of monitoring is needed in order to establish norms and convince individuals that others won’t exploit their efforts, communal monitoring should be used wherever possible. Not only is it often more effective to monitor horizontally and on a smaller-scale than costly and difficult hierarchical and large-scale monitoring, it also promotes trust and cohesion at the “meso” level, and influences the individuals’ views about their community standing and self-standing in the context.[^64] The provision of communal monitoring and sanctioning is itself a public good, but the self-determination, actualization of interests, and opportunity to do the perceived right thing that it provides results in the actors overcoming a regress of public goods dilemmas, which constitutes a solution (albeit involving human values and morality), to social dilemmas.[^65]

If monitoring systems must be enforced (such as when that would help to signal procedural fairness and provide necessary social norms), community support and engagement in design, and thereby identification with the social good, should be allowed and promoted, rather than imposing commands for action from above. This avoids the signalling of mistrust of actors and a low-status of them and their community relation, and avoids the entrenchment of selfish market norms which sanctions have been shown to induce. For this reason Van Vugt advocates scale-reduction of dilemmas to ease the communication of the problem, increase the actor’s relevance in it and the perceived potential for efficacy, and increase willingness to contribute by fostering social relations.[^66] The level of self-determination that people can act with increases their identification with the solution to the problem (be it contributing to an effort at a firm, or making sacrifices when one has to limit the use of a resource).

Taylor found that proposals in the US for siting “locally unwanted land uses” such as toxic waste sites, prisons, or airports, were never accepted by the residents if they lacked a platform for community engagement and deliberation, even if they offered large sums of money; whereas those that provided spaces for engagement, assurances to the community that burdens would be shared, and gave citizens a sense of a choice in the matter did find acceptance.[^67] Schlager found that in dealing with common pool resource dilemmas (such as a water shortage affecting irrigation systems or a forest shared by many different types of users) resource users can and did organize themselves to sustain the resource and outperformed central-government in their institutional arrangements, policy design for restricting use, and overall efficacy in conserving the resource. The users themselves were more in touch with the challenges facing their community, and designed more complex policies that served to monitor, manage and sustain the resource better. Homogeneity of resource users was not found to be an important factor in conservation, nor was the scale size of the resource user group, which was likely because smaller groups had less capital to draw on for constructing and implementing policy.[^68] For these reasons governmental support can take the form of actual support for local policies, rather than the imposition of policies to a problem.

All of these results provide a sketch of the conditions under which actors will be provided with good reasons for acting in accordance with the social good, and go to show that context, relations, and the identity (the ideals and norms) of the individual and the community determine levels of rational cooperative behaviour.
